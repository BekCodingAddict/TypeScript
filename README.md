# TypeScript
>[!NOTE]
>TypeScript is a programming language that builds on JavaScript by adding static types. Developed by Microsoft, it aims to make JavaScript development more robust by allowing developers to catch errors earlier, improve code organization, and facilitate large-scale applications.Here’s how it stands out:

- Static Typing: TypeScript lets you specify types for variables, function parameters, and return values, catching type-related errors during development rather than runtime.
- Type Inference: If you don’t specify a type, TypeScript can often infer it based on how the variable is used, making it easier to adopt without writing too many annotations.
Interfaces and Enums: TypeScript supports interfaces and enums, which help define structures for objects and sets of named values, adding consistency and clarity.
- Improved Tooling: TypeScript has excellent support in most modern editors, providing autocompletion, refactoring tools, and navigation.
Compatibility with JavaScript: Since TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, any valid JavaScript is also valid TypeScript, and you can incrementally adopt TypeScript in existing JavaScript projects.
- TypeScript code is transpiled into regular JavaScript, so it runs in any environment where JavaScript is supported (browsers, Node.js, etc.).
